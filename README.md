The analysis of the dataset revealed several insights about the hotel bookings:
•	Preference for City Hotel: The data showed that guests preferred City Hotel over Resort Hotel, with City Hotel accounting for more than 60% of the population. This suggests that guests tend to gravitate towards urban locations.

•	Majority of Adult Guests: Adult guests made up the majority of the guest list, while babies were the least represented. This indicates that the hotels cater more to adult clientele.

•	Low Repeated Guest Rate: Only 3.2% of guests were repeat customers. This suggests that the hotel may need to focus more on customer retention strategies to encourage repeat visits and increase guest loyalty.

•	Significant Booking Cancellations: Approximately 35% of bookings were canceled. This high cancellation rate may have implications for revenue management and operational planning, indicating the need to assess the reasons behind these cancellations and identify strategies to reduce them.

•	Fluctuating Booking Trends: Bookings more than doubled in 2016 compared to the previous year, but then decreased by more than 10% in the following year. This indicates a volatile market demand that should be monitored closely to make appropriate pricing and capacity adjustments.

•	Seasonal Booking Patterns: The analysis revealed that most bookings occurred between July and August, while the start and end of the year (November to February) had the least bookings. This seasonal trend suggests the need for targeted marketing campaigns and special offers during the slower periods to increase occupancy rates.

•	Guest Nationality Distribution: More than 80% of guests originated from PRT, GBR, FRA, ESP, and DEU. This information can guide marketing efforts to target these specific countries and tailor services to meet their preferences and cultural expectations.

•	Preferred Booking Distribution Channel: The majority of guests (more than 80%) preferred booking through Travel Agents/Tour Operators, while the GDS accounted for the least preferred channel. This insight highlights the importance of maintaining strong relationships with travel agents and optimizing distribution channels to maximize bookings.

Recommendations:
Based on these insights, here are some recommendations for the hotels:
•	Enhance Marketing and Promotion: Focus on targeted marketing efforts in countries such as PRT, GBR, FRA, ESP, and DEU to attract more guests from these regions. Consider tailoring promotional offers and content to cater to their preferences.

•	Customer Retention Strategies: Develop loyalty programs or incentives to increase the percentage of repeat guests. This could include perks such as discounted rates, exclusive benefits, or personalized services.

•	Improve Revenue Management: Analyze the reasons behind the high cancellation rate and develop strategies to reduce cancellations. This could involve implementing flexible booking policies, offering incentives for non-refundable bookings, or improving communication to manage guest expectations effectively.

•	Seasonal Promotions and Packages: Create special offers and packages during the slower periods (November to February) to attract guests and boost occupancy rates. This could include discounted rates, bundled services, or unique experiences tailored to the season.

•	Enhance Online Presence: Optimize the hotel's online booking platform and ensure its compatibility with popular Travel Agents/Tour Operators' systems. Streamline the booking process, provide attractive visual content, and prioritize positive guest reviews to increase direct bookings and improve the guest experience.

•	Continuous Market Monitoring: Keep a close eye on booking trends and market demand fluctuations to adjust pricing, availability, and marketing strategies accordingly. Regularly assess the competitive landscape to stay ahead of market trends and adapt the hotel's offerings as needed.

By implementing these recommendations, the hotels can aim to attract a diverse range of guests, improve customer retention, optimize revenue management, and enhance the overall guest experience.
