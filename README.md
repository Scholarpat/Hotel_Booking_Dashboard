# Hotel_Booking_Dashboard

About the dataset:
1. The dataset includes booking information for two hotels: City Hotel and a Resort Hotel.
2. The dataset comprises various features, including arrival date (year, month, and day), the number of adults, children, and babies, guest countries, meal type, market segment, distribution channels, reservation status, among others.
3. The dataset covers a period of three years: 2015, 2016, and 2017, containing a total of 119,390 rows, with 79,330 rows for City Hotel and 40,060 rows for Resort Hotel.
4. Specifically, City Hotel contains 13,682, 38,140, and 27,508 rows of data for 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Resort Hotel contains 8,314, 18,567, and 13,179 rows for 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.

The analysis of the dataset revealed several insights about the hotel bookings:

• Preference for City Hotel: The data indicates that guests preferred City Hotel over Resort Hotel, with City Hotel accounting for more than 60% of the total bookings. This suggests that Resort Hotel could benefit from implementing similar strategies used by City Hotel to attract more guests.

• Majority of Adult Guests: The majority of guests were adults, while babies were the least represented. This finding indicates that both hotels cater more to adult clientele and might consider offering family-friendly amenities to attract more families.

• Low Repeated Guest Rate: Only 3.2% of guests were repeat customers, implying a low rate of guest loyalty. To increase guest loyalty and encourage repeat visits, both hotels should focus on customer retention strategies and personalized services.

• Significant Booking Cancellations: Approximately 35% of bookings were canceled, revealing a high cancellation rate. This has potential implications for revenue management and operational planning. It is essential to investigate the reasons behind these cancellations and identify strategies to reduce them.

• Fluctuating Booking Trends: Bookings more than doubled in 2016 compared to the previous year, but then decreased by over 10% in the following year. This indicates a volatile market demand that requires close monitoring. Both hotels should be flexible in their pricing and capacity adjustments to accommodate fluctuating demands.

• Seasonal Booking Patterns: The analysis revealed that most bookings occurred between July and August, while the start and end of the year (November to February) had the least bookings. This seasonal trend suggests the need for targeted marketing campaigns and special offers during slower periods to increase occupancy rates.

• Guest Nationality Distribution: More than 80% of guests originated from PRT (Portugal), GBR (United Kingdom), FRA (France), ESP (Spain), and DEU (Germany). This information can guide marketing efforts to target these specific countries and tailor services to meet their preferences and cultural expectations.

• Preferred Booking Distribution Channel: The majority of guests (more than 80%) preferred booking through Travel Agents/Tour Operators, while the Global Distribution System (GDS) accounted for the least preferred channel. Both hotels should focus on maintaining strong relationships with travel agents and optimizing distribution channels to maximize bookings.

In conclusion, the analysis of the dataset provides valuable insights that can help both City Hotel and Resort Hotel refine their business strategies, improve guest experiences, and optimize operations for better performance and revenue generation.
